# Millinocket GridWorks Demo

This `DEMO` series will walk you through a high-fidelity simulation of a 10 MW Transactive Energy Resource (TER) in Millinocket Maine. It is designed to:

- Stress-test the technology in simulation before Efficienicy Maine deploys it in real homes;
- Bring developers up to speed on GridWorks; and
- Provide a platform for analyzing the engineering, economic, and regulatory issues involved in transforming our energy ecosystem.

## The Backdrop

This is a story about where the world's electric grids are now and where they need to go.
The story begins with what you probably already know. The world has major decarbonization commitments. For example, the US has just committed trillions of dollars in federal spending to decarbonize their economy by 2050.

One step is to dramatically increase renewable energy — mostly from wind farms and solar arrays.

Another is to electrify millions of things that today mostly run on fossil fuels — stoves, cars,
home heating systems.

It is a grand ambition with an inherent problem. As more things go electric, obviously the grid will
need to provide more electricity. Meanwhile the tried and true fossil-fuel ways of generating electricity — power plants running on coal, oil, natural gas — power plants that grid operators have relied on for many decades — are going away.

So the people operating the grid who know how to balance the grid — matching and anticipating the
electricity their customers want to use — they have a problem.

You cannot ramp up a solar array at night. And why would you want to throttle down a wind farm when
it’s cranking? And sure, EVs could potentially be storage devices when parked— but what they really
want to do is roll.

The exquisite solution is for electric hot water heating systems to replace
tens of millions of fossil-fuel boilers in buildings. With your help, these systems can use
and store sun-shining wind-blowing energy as heat when this energy is abundant — and cheaper —
and circulate the reserve of stored heat to keep people warm when electricity costs are high.

### Challenge: Balance

There’s another challenge to take on

It’s bitterly cold and windy in Millinocket, Maine in the wintertime.

The good thing? A lot of power is being generated nearby from the second and third largest
wind farms in New England. But there’s a problem — a bottleneck.

Part of the transmission system that could bring this wind energy to Southern Maine and the rest of
New England is here at Keene Road.

It’s a substation that, like a lot of parts of the current US electrical grid can't handle the
abundance of power that could (and should) be flowing from wind farms.

So the operators of the electric grid do in fact tell the wind farm owners to throttle it down.
Keene Road can’t handle it. The circuit breakers would trip, wires could melt. The industry word
for “don’t send it” is curtailment.

Gridworks is demonstrating what happens when hundreds of homes in and around Millinocket
know what to do with the abundance of wind. This demonstration is happening in simulation, and,
in parallel but a bit slower, in reality. In this demo, homes replace their oil and gas boilers
with heat pump water heaters and hot water storage, connecting to existing plumbing of
radiators, baseboard or radiant floors.

What’s most important about these Millinocket heating systems? They have the physical capacity -
both in terms of thermal storage and computational abilities - to prepare for the future and match
wind and solar output on the grid. They serve the needs of the grid by providing balance (electrons
in matching electrons out of the grid) on multiple timescales. And they simultaneously allow for
low-cost, low-carbon space heating.

How exactly does this work?

## In the field

Efficiency Maine is a quasi-governmental organization with a mandate to install 100,000 heat pumps across the state. They are concerned that they do not have a solution that is cost effective and that
can keep up with the coldest days. Therefore, they have funded a pilot project to test out the capabilities of transactive thermal storage heat systems. Over the next year, this will likely be
on the scale of 20 homes. If the solution proves to keep people warm and is cost effective, they
are poised to roll out rapidly at scale after that.
