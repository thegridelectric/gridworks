# GNodeAlias

GNodes have structured, mutable identifiers called GNodeAliases that serve several important functions
in GridWorks:

- taken together, they help define the topology of the electric grid
- they provide organizational structure to the communication between actors, as well as to the time-series state data generated.

Note for most developers, `alias` usually means an ephemeral or temporary moniker. `GNodeAlias` is
an exception to this rule.
