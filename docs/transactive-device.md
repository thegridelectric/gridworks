# Transactive Device

A **Transactive Device** is a tuple of 3 physical things:

- **An electrical device** connected to the grid that can consume and/or produce electrical power;
- **An electrical meter** that meters exactly the electrical device and has the accuracy characteristics required to meet existing and pending grid balancing challenges (that is, the challenge of keeping electric supply and electric demand in balance on various timescales as wind and solar electricity become more prevalent); and
- **A geographical location** of the location where the electrical device connects to the electric grid.
