Application Shared Languages
============================

The natural evolution of an API, an ASL is a language - or a collection of
messages - agreed upon by two software applications and/or actors.

Unlike an API, where the messages are all defined by one of the two
parties, and the flow of complex messages only goes one way (from the
server to the client), with an ASL both parties are exchanging complex
information.

In order to allow both parties to expressive creatively, to add to what
might be said, and at the same time to maintain both precision of meaning
and the ability to comprehend, one has to move beyond the typical API
framework.
