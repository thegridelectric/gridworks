# Physics of the Electric Grid

## Power and Energy

- **Power** is the instantaneous rate of flow of energy
  - Units: Watts, Horsepower, BTUs/hour, Ergs/sec, etc.
  - How powerful is your car? How large is this powerplant?
- **Energy** is power through time
  - Units: Watt-hours, Calories, BTUs, Joules, Foot-pounds, Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE), etc.
  - How much energy does it take to drive to New York? How much energy does this powerplant produce in a year?

## Grid Balancing

What do we mean when we talk about "the needs of the grid"? We mean grid balancing. What do we mean by "grid balancing"?

This means that the instantaneous power of all electric loads connected to the system must exactly equal the instantaneous electric power of all generators.
This also means, of course, that the amount of energy consumed over any period of time must be equal to the amount of energy generated over that time.
This is only true if we label the electricity put into storage (e.g. into a battery, an EV, or a hot water heater) as “consumption” and the electricity taken out of storage as “generation.”
