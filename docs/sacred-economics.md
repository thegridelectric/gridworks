# Sacred Economics

In Charles Eisensteinâ€™s proposed economic structure, innovation is supported through a combination of universal basic income, resource-backed currencies, and gift economics. UBI provides financial security, resource-linked mechanisms offer stable access to capital, and gift economics foster a collaborative and supportive community environment. This integrated approach ensures that individuals have the foundational support, access to resources, and social capital necessary to innovate, all while promoting ecological sustainability and social equity.
