# GNodeFactory

The GNodeFactory plays a foundational role in creating, authorizing and updating GNodes. It also plays a foundational role in tracking the known topology of the electric grid and providing validation that the energy transactions of Transactive Devices
are where, when and what they claim to be. This validation process uses the Algorand blockchain ledger and smart contracts.

It is used in the [demo](story) to create GridWorks in simulation.

Its open-souce repository can be found [here](https://github.com/thegridelectric/g-node-factory).
