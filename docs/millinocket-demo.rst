This is an explanation and summary of the results of a 10 MW Transactive Heating demo, simulating
800 heat pump thermal storage Transactive Devices in Millinocket Maine. The purpose of the demo is to:

- Stress-test the technology in simulation before Efficienicy Maine deploys it in real homes; and
- Provide a platform for analyzing the engineering, economic, and regulatory issues involved in transforming our energy ecosystem.
