GridWorks
=========

GridWorks uses distributed actors to balance the electric grid. What does this mean?  In today's world, more
power comes from highly variable power sources such as wind and solar. And yet, the number
of electrons going into the grid must match the number coming out.  This is where GridWorks comes in.
GridWorks technology enables electrical devices with some embedded storage or with flexibility to provide grid
balancing. Furthermore, GridWorks allows these appliances to be more thrifty, using electricity when
it is cheap and green.

See how GridWorks can support a cost-effective and rapid transition to a sustainable future by walking
through our `demo <story.html>`_.

This is a foundational Gridworks Python SDK.  To explore the rest of GridWorks, please visit:
